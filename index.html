                <h1>The Hackerspaces Tour</h1>
            	<p><em>aka &#8220;The Great Schlep&#8221;</em></p>
<h1>Where are we going, and why am I in this handbasket?</h1>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m writing a book about hackerspaces and hacker culture.</strong></p>
<p>In this project, I am covering the most interesting hackerspaces on both coasts. This includes New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington DC, San Francisco, Oakland, Seattle, and Vancouver.</p>
<p>Along the way, I am taking photos, writing about the positive impact that hackerspaces are having on their communities. I will also be working with various people to teach about privacy, security, and censorship.  If you have a suggestion of how to help out, drop me a line.</p>
<p>All photos will be released with a Creative Commons license. When I traveled to Occupy Wall Street, I took more than a thousand photos.  With at least eight cities and 30 days on this trip, I expect to shoot more than three thousand photos. Everyone who met me at <a href="http://www.hacdc.org" target="_blank">HacDC</a> can verify that I take <em>way</em> more photos of each space than I really expect to use.  In-person, my camera looks hilariously under-powered, but it&#8217;s a great camera, takes excellent photos, and is sturdy enough to make the trip!</p>
<h1>So&#8230; who&#8217;s paying for all this?</h1>
<p>Me. To conserve funds, I am travelling light and couchsurfing along the way. While I did run a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/680947501/hackerspaces-communities-making-technology-accessi" target="_blank">kickstarter</a>, it has not successfully funded (and I don&#8217;t expect it to). It&#8217;s okay though &#8212; if you&#8217;ve donated to Kickstarter projects before, you&#8217;ve probably got enough t-shirts and tote bags to last you a lifetime. <img src='http://cryptic.be/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>You can still donate to the project via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=X5WMTYJ97FZNN">Paypal</a> or <a href="https://www.wepay.com/donations/hackerspaces-tour">WePay</a>. All donations of at least $30 will be counted as a book pre-order, and donors can remain anonymous with WePay.</p>
